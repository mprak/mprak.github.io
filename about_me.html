		<br> <br> My name is Manu Prakasam (<i>MUH-noo PRUH-kah-sum</i>)
			and I'm a 3rd year EECS student at UC Berkeley. My interests are all over the place but generally
			I'm passionate about constantly learning more and working to better the world.
			I eventually hope to work at the intersection of business, technology,
			design, and social good.
			<br> <br> On campus I'm currently president of <a href="https://beacn.berkeley.edu" style="color:#1b9143"> <span class="beacn"> <b> BEACN </b> </span> </a>, a consulting group focused on environmental
			and social responsibility. This past summer, I interned with the Advanced Analytics team at <a href="https://www.numerify.com" style="color:#F2855F"> <span class="numerify"> <b> Numerify </b> </span> </a>,
			an IT analytics startup based in San Jose, and developed a tool for client site managers and senior consultants to discover actionable insights from client IT incident data much more quickly.
			<br> <br> A few things I love learning or chatting about, in no particular order:
			<ul>
				<li> environmental and social responsibility (especially in technology and in fashion) </li>
				<li> history (especially modern world history and Latin American history) </li>
				<li> design and marketing methodologies </li>
				<li> data privacy and computer security </li>
				<li> evolutionary biology and ecology </li>
			</ul>
			 A few things I love doing in my free time, also in no particular order:
			<ul>
				<li> reading newspaper and magazine articles (especially data-driven journalism!) </li>
				<li> doing sporcle quizzes and crosswords with friends (I love trivia!) </li>
				<li> watching Vox videos and TV shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine </li>
				<li> religiously following tennis (Djokovic fan since ~2007) </li>
			</ul>
			 If you'd like to chat or take a look at my resume, please feel free to shoot me an email at <b> mprakasam [at] berkeley.edu</b>!
