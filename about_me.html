    <div class = "about_me_description animate fadeInDown"> My name is Manu (<i>MUH-noo</i>) Prakasam (<i>PRUH-kah-sum</i>)
			and I am a 3rd year EECS student at UC Berkeley. My interests are all over the place but generally
			I'm passionate about constantly learning more and working to better the world.
			<br> <br> On campus I'm president of <a href="https://beacn.berkeley.edu" style="color:#416d34"> <span class="beacn"> <b> BEACN </b> </span> </a>, a consulting group focused on environmental
			and social responsibility. I have been in BEACN since my freshman year, previously working as a consultant on a CSR project for
			an ice cream franchise, a project manager on a market expansion project for a food recovery nonprofit, and as Vice President of
			Member Development, leading trainings and providing professional development opportunities for members.
			<br> <br> This past summer, I worked on the Advanced Analytics team at <a href="https://www.numerify.com" style="color:#4878B1"> <span class="numerify"> <b> Numerify </b> </span> </a>,
			an IT analytics startup based in San Jose. I developed an internal data science tool for client site managers and senior consultants to help
			them discover actionable insights in client IT data more quickly. The tool saved considerable time in identifying statistically significant trends in the data
			and discovering key subsets of the IT data and was piloted soon after I wrapped up my internship.
