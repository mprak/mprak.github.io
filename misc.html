					<br> <br>
					For my sister's wedding over the summer of 2019, I designed two wedding logos: a larger one (for use on the dance floor, coconuts, and more)
					and a smaller one (for uses on wedding related documents as seen above). I also designed a wedding program that explained the steps of religious ceremony,
					a wedding guide that detailed all the different events of the wedding and the features of the resort, and a thank you note that was included
					in the gifts to all the guests. I created all of these in Illustrator. The logos I created from scratch, and everything else I created through a combination of
					manipulating vector elements (that I found from Freepik and Flaticon) and creating elements from scratch.

					<br> <br>
					Above are some of my attempts in Illustrator to create a new logo for my consulting organization, BEACN. As I mention <a href = "beacn.html" style="color:#3DA1D0">here</a>, as president of BEACN, I ended up designing a lot of our marketing material.
					A problem that came up quite often when trying to develop marketing material was designing around our logo. Our logo has been around since our inception
					in 2006 and it really has not updated with the times and new design standards. I was often
					not able to find any font that matched well with our logo which led to a lot of headaches. To try and solve this problem, I embarked
					on an exercise to develop a new logo for BEACN to help start the process of building out a new brand identity for the club, complete with
					suggested color palettes and font guidelines that followed from the logo. This process ended up being a lot more difficult than I
					expected at the beginning, as it was difficult to build something that stayed true to our mission and our already known identity on campus,
					in the community, and with clients, while also being more modern and worked well for all purposes, from branding material to placement on our
					club apparel. I tried playing around with different leaf designs, three leaves signifiying the triple bottom line of
					people, planets, and profits, which is a core principle that drives our work. I also tried a bear design to represent
					both our school's mascot, the golden bear, as well as a polar bear, which has become a symbol of climate change.
					I also played around with different font weights and capitalization (some of the attempts can be seen above).
					I wanted to create a logo that could stand alone from the name "BEACN", but it was hard to create something that was not generic.
					I ultimately could not finish this project as I had to focus on other
					more important club functions like planning for new member recruitment and finalizing client acquisition. Despite this, it was a fun exercise
					and I learned a bit on what it takes to build a brand identity. I'd like to thank some of my friends (Claire Burch, Varna Vasudevan, Divya Nekkanti,
					Sarah Tang, and Ian Utz) who were great sounding boards through these attempts.

					<br> <br>
					After seeing a few different campus marketing campaigns with
					this line pattern, namely from events put on Berkeley Innovation and TEDxBerkeley,
					I was wondering if I could create it myself. I ended up figuring out that these
					designs could be created using the <i>blend function</i> in Adobe Illustrator which
					essentially creates even and smooth transitions between objects or colors and I tried
					it out for myself. After creating a nice gradient background (side note: I just noticed
					that Illustrator added a new gradient type, so I'll have to see if I can integrate that
					into my ten days somehow), I created two lines using the pen tool. I then used
					the blend tool (Object > Blend > Make), specifying 20 steps in between the two lines, and
					came to this result. I'll definitely have to see how I can use the blend tool in the future
					as I have learned that it can also be used to distribute colors between two objects and there
					are a couple other options for the tool that I did not quite figure out.

					<br> <br>
					Today I tried to be a little bit more ambitious and decided to try something more time consuming. Back when
					I first learned Illustrator, I often used to check out Vectips, a website with Illustrator resources,
					and try to follow the tutorials, so I decided to head on over to Vectips and find something interesting to do.
					I ended up choosing a Halloween background even though Halloween was a few months ago simply because I liked
					how the image looked. This took me roughly about an hour to complete and although there are some
					issues with colors, relative sizing of objects, and positioning, I'm pretty pleased with the end result.
					I ended up learning quite a few more tools/features including <i>shape builder</i>, <i>offset path</i>, <i>reflect</i>, <i>outline path</i>,
					and my personal favorite, the <i>scissor tool</i>. With the shape builder and scissor tools now in my arsenal, I
					definitely feel like there is a lot more now that I can potentially create on Illustrator. Something else interesting
					about today's project is that I got to use the blend tool again (to create the steps leading up to the door), so
					I can already see how different tools I have been learning can be used in conjunction with one another.
					One thing that I would like to get better at with respect to Illustrator is memorizing and using keyboard
					shortcuts, which I use constantly in every other program I use as they save a lot of time. Another thing in general with
					design and illustration that I hope to get better at is being able to translate something from my mind to the screen or
					the page better without having to look at reference material, and I think that will come as I practice more and see more
					examples of design.

					<br> <br>
					Today, I decided to turn my attention over to Photoshop, with which I have not had as much experience as compared to Illustrator. A few days back, I got
					an design inspiration email from Adobe Creative Cloud and one of the images was this image of a hand with a
					neon effect around it, so I decided to give it a go myself. With today's project, I learned a few new features/tools:
					<i> add layer effect</i>, <i> add layer mask</i>, and <i> convert to smart object</i>. With add layer effect, I was able to add an inner and outer glow
					to my shape to get the neon effect and with add layer mask, I was able to add layering to the image by removing part of the triangle to make it seem
					as though the triangle went behind their heads. The image I edited today is an image of my sister and her fianc&#233;
					at their engagement shoot. I originally tried to edit an image of myself but the neon effect did not really add anything to the image and in fact,
					made it look a little weird. I then tried this engagement shot, converted it to black and white to allow for a greater contrast between
					the shape and the image, and created a shape that traced their lines of sight to greater emphasize the attention
					and care they are conveying to each other in this shot. While I love the original image, I think this edited image also turned out really well! Additionally,
					while this was a relatively simple edit, I am excited to see what more I can do with Photoshop as I learn more and more features.

					<br> <br>
					Today, I decided to use Photoshop again. I have seen this style of paper art a number of times and I've always enjoyed it, whether
					it's real paper (check out @sabeenu on Instagram!) or digitally created. Since I didn't want to waste paper, I decided to try to make
					the effect digitally. I think I would have preferred to have tried this on Illustrator since I'm a little more familiar with where
					all the tools are, but it was a nice challenge to do it on Photoshop. While creating today, I learned about <i>inner and drop shadows </i> (and I particularly loved
						the <i> global light </i> option, allowing for a standardization of shadow angles!), <i> filtering with noise </i>, and the <i> soft light blend mode </i>. I definitely want
						to play around more with the different filtering options and the different blend modes as there are so many options to choose from and I am not quite
						sure which ones work best in which situations. I am not super pleased with today's result as I definitely could have done an more interesting interior object (instead of the moon and stars)
						but I was getting a little frustrated with the pen tool and creating pleasing cut outs. Additionally, I am not sure how I feel about the craters on the moon or the number
						of stars in the image. I think there are so many possibilities with this style of art (e.g. I've seen beautiful animations
						with this style) so I definitely want to try my hand at it again and create something more interesting. Something else that I want to try when doing paper art again
						is potentially trying to make certain shapes (like the stars in this image) look like bent paper. I think that would look really cool and it would allow me to play a little more with the
						3D effects on Photoshop.

					<br> <br>
					Today I decided to go back to Illustrator, because I really enjoy the feeling of creating something from scratch. This is possible
					in Photoshop as well of course, but I feel that Illustrator is more suited to and is made for this. I went on Vectips today and found
					this whale. Today's piece was not too complicated, but I still got to use a couple new tools and features: <i>inverted corners</i>,
					<i>the divide tool in the pathfinder window</i>, <i>eraser tool</i>, <i>paste in front</i> (which doesn't seem that groundbreaking, but
					was really useful and will definitely be in the future). I decided to add something extra to the piece with a gradient in the background.
					Illustrator recently added the freeform gradient tool and I decided give it a try. It was quite easy to use and I think it made
					today's piece a little more interesting. I've really been enjoying using Illustrator more but I hope to get better at having an eye for
					how to make a project look better with a few small changes or in other words, I hope to develop a design intuition. For example, I'm not really sure about my placement of the whale eye,
					the lines around the whale, the bottom half of the whale body, and the bubbles and water spray coming from the whale.

					<br> <br>
					Today I decided to follow another Vectips tutorial and this one caught my eye as it seemed to involve some text manipulation. This
					ended up being a really cool excercise in Illustrator as I got the chance to learn how to create a <i>new brush</i> to create the erased
					chalk effect in the background and create a <i>new pattern</i> to get the chalk effect for the actual text. I also used <i>grain</i>, <i>multiply</i>, <i>blending</i> and a <i>radial gradient</i>
					to make the background look as close to a used chalkboard as possible.

					This was part of an assignment I did for my data science class (Computer Science C100), and it was the assignment

					Looked at sentiment, polarity, time, devices used, topics, etc. as well as combinations of these variables.
