			<br> <br>
		In October 2018, I had the great fortune of getting to participate in a Google Cloud Case Competition
		hosted by DiversaTech with some of my friends from BEACN (Sarah Tang, Grace Pratt, and Kaautam
		Uthaya Suriyan). The objective of the competition was to make the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
		more accessible to students. We ended up coming in 2nd place after coming up with a three-pronged
		strategy to recognize, understand, and master GCP, leveraging students'
		familiarity with Google Drive, modifying the GCP website, and utilizing existing on-campus
		opportunities. This was my first case competition since freshman year (and my second one ever) and
		it was an absolute blast working and winnning Google Homes with this group!

		<br> <br> Here's <a href="https://tinyurl.com/GCPDeck" style="color:#3DA1D0"> our full slide deck </a> from the competition.
		Additionally, you can find a selection of these slides below.
		I designed our overall template (dividing the sections of our presentation with different colors that matched
		the Google logo), designed our user persona and pathway slide templates, and created the "understand" section.

					<br> <br>
					After seeing a few different campus marketing campaigns with
					this line pattern, namely from events put on Berkeley Innovation and TEDxBerkeley,
					I was wondering if I could create it myself. I ended up figuring out that these
					designs could be created using the <i> blend function </i> in Adobe Illustrator which
					essentially creates even and smooth transitions between objects or colors and I tried
					it out for myself. After creating a nice gradient background (side note: I just noticed
					that Illustrator added a new gradient type, so I'll have to see if I can integrate that
					into my 21 days somehow), I created two lines using the pen tool. I then used
					the blend tool (Object > Blend > Make), specifying 20 steps in between the two lines, and
					came to this result. I'll definitely have to see how I can use the blend tool in the future
					as I have learned that it can also be used to distribute colors between two objects and there
					are a couple other options for the tool that I did not quite figure out.
