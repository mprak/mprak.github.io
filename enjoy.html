		I really enjoy consuming all types of media but I do not always remember everything
		that ran through my head immediately after watching a incredibly affecting comedy special
		like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80233611" style="color:#3DA1D0">
		Nanette </a> or after listening to a disturbing yet consuming podcast series like
		<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html"
		style="color:#3DA1D0">
			Caliphate </a>. Therefore, my intention is to use this page to
			collect my thoughts from everything I've enjoyed reading, watching, and listening
			to over the course of the year.
