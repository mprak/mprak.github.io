		I really enjoy consuming all types of media but I do not always remember everything
		that ran through my head immediately after watching a incredibly affecting comedy special
		like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80233611" style="color:#3DA1D0">
		Nanette </a> or after listening to a disturbing yet consuming podcast series like
		<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html"
		style="color:#3DA1D0">
			Caliphate </a>. Therefore, my intention is to use this page to
			collect my thoughts from everything I've enjoyed reading, watching, and listening
			to over the course of the year.

			Resolutions to Stick<img src=assets/img/logos/yt.png style="height:16px; padding-left: 10px" /> </a> </p>
			<p class="enjoy-comments"> I began watching Matt D'Avella's videos last year
			and I've always been impressed by his editing, from audio quality to transitions to music selection,
		which is always incredibly clean and non-obtrusive to the level that you'd not necessarily even notice it.
	Something that I liked in particular about this video was Matt's suggestion to construct your dream day and reverse
engineer what habits you'd like to form, which I haven't seen in any of the <i> many </i> videos I've seen on this subject. </p>

			<p class="enjoy-comments">  I've long enjoyed tennis because I feel that it is the sport where men and women are treated most equally, in large part due to the efforts of
			players like Billie Jean King and the original nine. While it is not completely equal, men and women earn the same amount
			at the grand slams and compete on the same stages. One of the events I enjoy most every year is the Hopman Cup, where women and men
				from the same country compete together. The mixed doubles matches when men and women compete on the same court together are particularly fun to watch.
				However, the Hopman Cup is likely ending this year as several additional men's team tennis events are
				popping up after the success of the Laver Cup and the current transitional period of the Davis Cup. Increasingly, female tennis players and tournaments including are being treated as afterthoughts,
				even though female players have brought in far more revenue than male players during certain periods and co-ed tennis events are the highest attended events on the tour.
				I hope that tournament organizers and people in power in tennis recognize the value of showcasing both male and female players and keep
				exciting team events like Hopman Cup where men and women get to compete together.

			<p class="enjoy-comments"> This article came out last year, but I just came across it for the first time. I had no idea that a practice called <i> bacha posh </i>
			happened in Afghanistan, in which "some parents raise their daughters as sons to provide them with a better life." It's unfortunate that gender roles are so entrenched
	and that women are so undervalued that a practice like this occurs. In an effort to better their children's lives, these parents often unfortunately
	leave their children without a place in society. These children enjoy their greater status and social mobility, but as they grow older, "puberty reveals their biological gender" and life becomes much harder.
	At this time, a child "learns that it is not possible for her to be a boy and nobody accepts her as a girl."

			<p class="enjoy-comments"> Andy Murray was never my favorite player on court. However, when he announced his plans for retirement this year due to a chronic hip problem, I was struck with emotion.
			This article, by one of my new favorite tennis journalists from the last year, Giri Nathan, does a good job of explaining what made Andy Murray so special. Murray competed against three of the greatest players of all
			time yet still came away with two olympic gold medals, three grand slams, months at world number one, and ended Great Britain's 77 year long Grand Slam drought. Moreover, he's one of the greatest returners of all time, a dogged competitor,
			and a brilliant tactician but what made him even more special, and what this article touches on, is his personality. His dryness, his petulance, his intelligence, and his brutal honesty are what make him hilarous and quite a bit different
			from the rest of the tour, who often sound much more polished and in turn, inauthentic. Moreover, as Cristopher Clarey of the New York Times writes in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/sports/andy-murray-retirement.html" style="color:#3DA1D0"> his celebration of Murray's career </a>,
			Murray is unlike other players on the men's tour, being an ardent supporter of gender equality, actively following women's tennis, and hiring a female coach in Amelie Mauresmo. His voice is incredibly important for the sport and
			as Juan Martin Del Potro, a person who has had his fair share of devastating injuries, wrote (in <a href="https://twitter.com/delpotrojuan/status/1083554349056446465" style="color:#3DA1D0"> a tweet </a> that made me tear up),
			I really hope that Murray can overcome this chronic pain and get to retire on his own terms.
