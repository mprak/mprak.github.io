		I really enjoy consuming all types of media but I do not always remember everything
		that ran through my head immediately after watching a incredibly affecting comedy special
		like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80233611" style="color:#3DA1D0">
		Nanette </a> or after listening to a disturbing yet consuming podcast series like
		<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html"
		style="color:#3DA1D0">
			Caliphate </a>. Therefore, my intention is to use this page to
			collect my thoughts from everything I've enjoyed reading, watching, and listening
			to over the course of the year.

			<p class="enjoy-comments"> I began watching Matt D'Avella's videos last year
			and I've always been impressed by his editing, from audio quality to transitions to music selection,
		which is always incredibly clean and non-obtrusive to the level that you'd not necessarily even notice it.
	Something that I liked in particular about this video was Matt's suggestion to construct your dream day and reverse
engineer what habits you'd like to form, which I haven't seen in any of the <i> many </i> videos I've seen on this subject. </p>
