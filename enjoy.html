		I really enjoy consuming all types of media but I do not always remember everything
		that ran through my head after watching a incredibly affecting comedy special
		like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80233611" style="color:#3DA1D0">
		Nanette </a> or after listening to a disturbing yet consuming podcast series like
		<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html"
		style="color:#C6866A">
			Caliphate </a>.
		Therefore, my intention is to use this page to collect my thoughts from what I have enjoyed
		over the year.
