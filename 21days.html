			<br> <br>
		I absolutely love looking at examples of brilliant design and data visualization,
		but I haven't taken much time the last few years to learn skills associated with either.
		In the three weeks leading up to classes resuming for spring semester, I'm attempting to
		learn at least one new data visualization or design skill per day.

					<br> <br>
					After seeing a few different campus marketing campaigns with
					this line pattern, namely from events put on Berkeley Innovation and TEDxBerkeley,
					I was wondering if I could create it myself. I ended up figuring out that these
					designs could be created using the <i> blend function </i> in Adobe Illustrator which
					essentially creates even and smooth transitions between objects or colors and I tried
					it out for myself. After creating a nice gradient background (side note: I just noticed
					that Illustrator added a new gradient type, so I'll have to see if I can integrate that
					into my 21 days somehow), I created two lines using the pen tool. I then used
					the blend tool (Object > Blend > Make), specifying 20 steps in between the two lines, and
					came to this result. I'll definitely have to see how I can use the blend tool in the future
					as I have learned that it can also be used to distribute colors between two objects and there
					are a couple other options for the tool that I did not quite figure out.
