			<br> <br>
		I absolutely love looking at examples of brilliant design and data visualization,
		but I haven't taken much time the last few years to learn skills associated with either.
		In the three weeks leading up to classes resuming for spring semester, I'm attempting to
		learn at least one new data visualization or design skill per day.

					<br> <br>
					After seeing a few different campus marketing campaigns with
					this line pattern, namely from events put on Berkeley Innovation and TEDxBerkeley,
					I was wondering if I could create it myself. I ended up figuring out that these
					designs could be created using the <i>blend function</i> in Adobe Illustrator which
					essentially creates even and smooth transitions between objects or colors and I tried
					it out for myself. After creating a nice gradient background (side note: I just noticed
					that Illustrator added a new gradient type, so I'll have to see if I can integrate that
					into my 21 days somehow), I created two lines using the pen tool. I then used
					the blend tool (Object > Blend > Make), specifying 20 steps in between the two lines, and
					came to this result. I'll definitely have to see how I can use the blend tool in the future
					as I have learned that it can also be used to distribute colors between two objects and there
					are a couple other options for the tool that I did not quite figure out.

					<br> <br>
					Today I tried to be a little bit more ambitious and decided to try something more time consuming. Back when
					I first learned Illustrator, I often used to check out Vectips, a website with Illustrator resources,
					and try to follow the tutorials, so I decided to head on over to Vectips and find something interesting to do.
					I ended up choosing a Halloween background even though Halloween was a few months ago simply because I liked
					how the image looked. This took me roughly about an hour to complete and although there are some
					issues with colors, relative sizing of objects, and positioning, I'm pretty pleased with the end result.
					I ended up learning quite a few more tools/features including <i>shape builder</i>, <i>offset path</i>, <i>reflect</i>, <i>outline path</i>,
					and my personal favorite, the <i>scissor tool</i>. With the shape builder and scissor tools now in my arsenal, I
					definitely feel like there is a lot more now that I can potentially create on Illustrator. Something else interesting
					about today's project is that I got to use the blend tool again (to create the steps leading up to the door), so
					I can already see how different tools I have been learning can be used in conjunction with one another.
					One thing that I would like to get better at with respect to Illustrator is memorizing and using keyboard
					shortcuts, which I use constantly in every other program I use as they save a lot of time. Another thing in general with
					design and illustration that I hope to get better at is being able to translate something from my mind to the screen or
					the page better without having to look at reference material, and I think that will come as I practice more and see more
					examples of design.

					<br> <br>
					Today, I decided to turn my attention over to Photoshop, with which I have not had as much experience as compared to Illustrator. A few days back, I got
					an design inspiration email from Adobe Creative Cloud and one of the images was this image of a hand with a
					neon effect around it, so I decided to give it a go myself. With today's project, I learned a few new features/tools:
					<i> add layer effect</i>, <i> add layer mask</i>, and <i> convert to smart object</i>. With add layer effect, I was able to add an inner and outer glow
					to my shape to get the neon effect and with add layer mask, I was able to add layering to the image by removing part of the triangle to make it seem
					as though the triangle went behind their heads. The image I edited today is an image of my sister and her fianc&#233;
					at their engagement shoot. I originally tried to edit an image of myself but the neon effect did not really add anything to the image and in fact,
					made it look a little weird. I then tried this engagement shot, converted it to black and white to allow for a greater contrast between
					the shape and the image, and created a shape that traced their lines of sight to greater emphasize the attention
					and care they are conveying to each other in this shot. While I love the original image, I think this edited image also turned out really well! Additionally,
					while this was a relatively simple edit, I am excited to see what more I can do with Photoshop as I learn more and more features.
