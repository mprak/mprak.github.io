			<br> <br>
		While recruiting for an APM position, I was invited to complete a product challenge. The exercise was to <strong> select
		a KPI and submit a spec for a new/reimagined feature in the mobile app to improve that KPI </strong>.
		An additional limitation was that the document could be no longer than five slides (not including the title slide) and
		had to communicate enough information that engineers and designers could get started with the feature. I really had a great
		time working on this challenge and pushing myself to be creative and a little less pragmatic than usual. I ended
		up proposing a <strong> song of the week feature </strong> for the app to introduce users to a different, immersive means of learning (music) and create a differentiated
		product experience over time to incentivize users to revisit the app regularly (rather than through other strategies like streaks or XP challenges that
		require a larger level of buy-in from users to care about).

		<br> <br> Below you can find my full slide deck from the candidate exercise.
		It was definitely a challenge to fit in all the content I wanted in just five slides (hence the text-heavy slides),
		but I am proud of the overall template, slides, and wireframes I designed.
