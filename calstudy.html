		my friends and I went out to study we often found ourselves always heading to the same places to study or taking a really
		long time to decide where we should go out to study because we had gotten tired of our go-to study location. Studies have shown
		that when a student changes where they study regularly, their grades and memory improve (links to

		I created a prototype in Adobe XD for an application that would solve this
		problem. This application allows users to search their surrounding areas for study locations,
		book study rooms, generate a random study location based on preferences/needs, and keep track of study location history.
		Scroll down to see more of the features explained, to interact with a prototype, and to see a video walkthrough
		of the application.

		clicking through and trying all the features of the application.

					<br> <br>
					After seeing a few different campus marketing campaigns with
					this line pattern, namely from events put on Berkeley Innovation and TEDxBerkeley,
					I was wondering if I could create it myself. I ended up figuring out that these
					designs could be created using the <i> blend function </i> in Adobe Illustrator which
					essentially creates even and smooth transitions between objects or colors and I tried
					it out for myself. After creating a nice gradient background (side note: I just noticed
					that Illustrator added a new gradient type, so I'll have to see if I can integrate that
					into my 21 days somehow), I created two lines using the pen tool. I then used
					the blend tool (Object > Blend > Make), specifying 20 steps in between the two lines, and
					came to this result. I'll definitely have to see how I can use the blend tool in the future
					as I have learned that it can also be used to distribute colors between two objects and there
					are a couple other options for the tool that I did not quite figure out.
