	Last year, I was president of BEACN, a consulting group
	focused on environmental and social responsibility. Given that we did not have
	anyone dedicated to marketing, I designed
	for most of our external events. What follows is some of the material I designed for BEACN in the last year. I have also led our design
	general meeting for the last three semesters to introduce our members to
	design and learn the skills they need to succeed on our projects. Some other things I have designed for BEACN that I cannot
	showcase here include alumni newsletters and slide decks and templates for infosessions, general meetings, and projects.

				<br> <br>
				Designed main cover photo for BEACN Facebook page in Photoshop. Designed Facebook cover photos in Photoshop (one seen above) for three
				different cycles of new member recruitment. Made sure cover photo worked as an event cover photos and profile cover photos for
				both mobile and desktop. Designed separate cover photos for Facebook/Instagram paid event promotions (not seen above). Designed summer
				internship map in Keynote to keep Facebook page active during the summer and boost engagement on the page. Created cover photos in Keynote for multiple
				external events (one seen above) that BEACN hosted over the semester.

				<br> <br>
				Redesigned business cards for our recruitment table using Photoshop. Moved away from flyers for the first time. Flyers previously contained
				recruitment event dates and could not be reused for the next semester, whereas business cards were smaller, made from
				post-consumer recycled material, and could be reused for subsequent semesters.

				<br> <br>
				First major redesign of the <a href="https://beacn.berkeley.edu" style="color:#3DA1D0"> BEACN website </a> since 2016.
				Used Wordpress to keep on Berkeley domain. Modified CSS to make website more mobile-friendly. Created consistency in brand elements across social media, website,
				slide decks, and other recruitment marketing material. Mockup template courtesy Anthony Boyd Graphics.
