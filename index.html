	<div class = "about_me_description animate fadeIn" id="about_me">

		My name is Manu Prakasam (<i>MUH-noo PRUH-kah-sum</i>)
		and I'm a 4th year EECS student at UC Berkeley. My interests are all over the place but generally
		I'm passionate about constantly learning more and working to better the world.
		I eventually hope to work at the intersection of business, technology,
		design, and social good.
		<br> <br> This summer, I was a product manager intern at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com" style="color:#1974BB"> <span class="nyt"> <b> The New York Times </b> </span> </a>, working on the Messaging Capabilities team
		within the Digital Subscription Growth group.
		This past school year, I was president of <a href="https://beacn.berkeley.edu" style="color:#1b9143"> <span class="beacn"> <b> BEACN </b> </span> </a>, a consulting group focused on environmental
		and social responsibility. Last summer, I interned with the Advanced Analytics team at <a href="https://www.numerify.com" style="color:#F2855F"> <span class="numerify"> <b> Numerify </b> </span> </a>,
		an IT analytics startup based in San Jose.
		<br> <br> A few things I love learning or chatting about include, in no particular order:
		environmental and social responsibility (especially in technology and in fashion),
		modern world and Latin American history, design and
		marketing methodologies, data privacy and computer security, the business of
		entertainment, tennis, and data-driven journalism.
		<br> <br>
